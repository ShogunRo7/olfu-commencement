                        <h2><b>A HUMBLE BEGINNING</b></h2>
                        <div class="p1">In 1967, Jose C. Olivares, a Chemistry professor-entrepreneur and his son-in-law Dr. Vicente M. Santos, a physician, founded Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in Valenzuela, a former municipality of Bulacan. The hospital immediately became the primary provider of medical and health care services for the residents of Valenzuela.</div>
                        <div class="p1">Mr. Olivares, who was then a professor at the Ateneo de Manila University, envisioned a dream for Fatima.  He set his eyes in transforming the Our Lady of Fatima Hospital from a general hospital to a medical complex that will be the training ground for health care providers such as nurses and midwives. 
						Thus, in 1973, the Our Lady of Fatima College of Nursing was established.  
						And in 1976, the first batch of Nursing graduates garnered an unprecedented 100% passing average in the Nursing Board examinations. </div>

						Mr. Olivares even further by establishing the Fatima Medical Science Foundation, Inc.
						– Fatima College of Medicine.  Since then, Fatima College of Medicine has made its mark in medical education by producing holistically-empowered graduates who are consistent Medical Board topnotchers and highly respected medical physicians..</div>

The Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities (ACSCU), another prestigious accrediting body,					
						would eventually give its mark of excellence to our Graduate School programs in MA in Nursing, MA in Educational Management, MA in Teaching, Master in Public Administration, Master in Business     Administration, together
						with our undergraduate programs in Psychology and Biology.  Fatima Medical Science Foundation- Fatima College of Medicine was also accredited by the Association of Philippine Medical Colleges, the New York State Board of Education and the Illinois State Board of Education.  The College of Maritime Education, in turn, was ISO certified 9002: 1994 and included in the Commission on Higher Education’s White List (in 1998) as a qualified provider of maritime education.</div>

                       <div class="p1">The next five years further saw a dramatic increase in infrastructure development. Modern buildings were established in Valenzuela City. OLFU made its presence known in Fairview, Quezon City with its new campus overlooking the La Mesa reservoir.
In 1996, the institution started to offer two programs, the Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy and BS in Occupational Therapy and the students were housed at Fatima Physical Rehabilitation Center and Eye Clinic at Regalado, Fairview, and Quezon City. On the succeeding year, the program offerings increased, namely BS in HRM, BS in Tourism, BS in Psychology, BS in Biology, BS in Nursing and BS in Computer Science.</div>

                       <div class="p1">The transformation of the college and conversion to a university in December 2002 was indeed a long-awaited fulfillment of the pioneering dream of the founders of this institution. The installation of  Dr. Vicente M. Santos, as the First University President was a fitting tribute to a quiet and simple man whose empowering commitment and devotion to Our Lady of Fatima College inspired and propelled the men and women of the college to move from its humble beginning to its special niche as a premiere educational institution.  Indeed, through the years, Our Lady of Fatima University has embraced the basic educational philosophy of “improving man as a man” and emulated the virtues of “veritas et misericordia” (truth and compassion) in upholding the tradition of academic excellence. After the death of Dr. Vicente M. Santos in 2003, Dr. Juliet O. Santos became the second President of the University. Through her unique hands-on leadership, she steered the University to new heights.</div>

Thus, OLFU Antipolo was launched and just like in Quezon City, the people of Antipolo and nearby towns of Rizal acknowledged the coming of the University as a major provider of quality education.

					<h2><b>COD AND IQUAME</b></h2>
                       <div class="p1"> The strong demand for nurses abroad required strengthening the nursing curriculum by infusing the program with state-of-the-art nursing virtual laboratories and simulators first seen in Philippine medical education in a wide-scale mock-hospital setting. 
					   These cutting-edge technology-driven learning tools offered a wide range of patient scenarios where students can perform an array of diverse nursing procedures. This paved the way for OLFU’s College of Nursing to be designated by CHED as a CENTER OF DEVELOPMENT in late 2008. With the prestige and recognition it has accumulated through voluntary accreditation of its programs within the framework of the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines,
					   the Our Lady of Fatima University in 2008, voluntary subjected itself to CHED’s Institutional Quality Assurance Through Monitoring and Evaluation (IQuAME)
					   resulting to, in early 2009, being placed in CATEGORY A(t) as a mature teaching university.</div>
